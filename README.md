# A simple Python certificate authority server

This is a program that runs a server to authorize certificate signing requests
for all your webserver needs. Hopefully, you won't have to rely on external
parties for all your information or filesharing needs under encryption within
your own home. This project is mainly to serve my own needs.

If you think you're seeing this again, then know that it's because I messed up
with a commit, and therefore had to re-initialize this repo.

This project should be assumed to be using a Creative Commons CC0 License.
If it doesn't appear that way, then either I didn't set it up correctly,
or something went wrong - presumably from my end - in setting it up.
Either way, you are free to copy, modify, and share your versions, so long
as it's useful.

EVERYTHING PROVIDED HERE IS GIVEN IN AN AS-IS NATURE. I SHOULD NOT BE HELD
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RECEIVED BY YOU DUE TO SELF-INFLICTED HARMFUL
PROGRAMMING. BY USING THIS YOU ACCEPT THAT ANY MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR SYSTEM
WERE DONE BY YOUR OWN ACTIONS, AND THAT WHEN YOU RECEIVED THIS CODE, IT WAS
NEVER MEANT TO MODIFY YOUR FILESYSTEM (EXCEPT IN THE CONTAINING FOLDER),
YOUR PHYSICAL DEVICES, YOUR LOCAL NETWORK'S STABILITY, OR ANY OTHER MISCELLANEOUS
PROPERTY BELONGING TO YOU. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR IGNORANCE OR LACK OF
ATTENTION TO THE FUNCTIONS OF THIS CODE.

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS AS A WORLD-WIDE-WEB SERVER.
