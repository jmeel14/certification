Welcome to the Certification Authority setup wizard.

This wizard will guide you through the process of setting up the
Certification Authority, which is used to sign certificates for
any secure web server. It will ask you a series of questions to
build your CA.+

This stage will ask you 2 questions about how you will host your CA:
your CA IP address, and your CA port.+

Please enter what address the CA will listen to for certificate
requests. It should look like this *.*.*.*.
Host IP received.+

Please enter the port that you would like to bind the server to. It
can be any number that is usable on your server machine, from
1 to 65535.
Host port received.+

This stage of the wizard will ask questions that you must enter
knowing that these details will be used as your Certificate
Authority's (CA) details on any certificates that it will issue.
The questions that you will be asked will be:
CA common name, CA organization name, and CA organization unit name+

Please enter the common name of the CA's organization. I don't know
what this means, but just put in the organization name or its
organization website.
CA CN received.+

Please enter the CA organization's name. This will be how your CA
will be recognized by other humans (and computers, if they're
picky).
CA ON received.+

Please enter the CA organization's unit name. This can be whatever,
really.
CA OU received.+

This final stage will set up your CA's credentials, which will enable it
to sign certificates from your connected services. It will only ask you
one question; your CA password.+

Please enter your CA password now.
CA PK Password received.+
